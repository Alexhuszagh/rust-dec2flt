# rust-dec2flt

A minimal fork of the Rust core library to enhance Rust's float parsing algorithms. All contribution guidelines, authorship, and licensing information is identical to the Rust core library.

This will only compile on nightly, in order to make use of the same intrinsics and features as the core library.

This is based off of commit [2bafe96272bf22cd191c6a01741184b60063292d](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/2bafe96272bf22cd191c6a01741184b60063292d).
