# rust-dec2flt

A minimal fork of the Rust core library to enhance Rust's float parsing algorithms. All contribution guidelines, authorship, and licensing information is identical to the Rust core library. This will only compile on nightly, in order to make use of the same intrinsics and features as the core library. This is in archival mode right now, since the main pull request to update the float-parsing algorithms has been submitted. Feel free to base any work off of this, however.

This is based off of commit [2bafe96272bf22cd191c6a01741184b60063292d](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/2bafe96272bf22cd191c6a01741184b60063292d).
